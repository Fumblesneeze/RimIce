  <description>Adds Ice to Rimworld.

* Build ice walls and sculptures
* Ice blocks, walls and sculptures will cool the area but deteriorate
* Repair ice things with more ice blocks
* Ice blocks can be dug from ice terrain or bought from traders, price will vary depending on the temperature
* Lakes and marshes freeze in winter and during cold snaps
* You can build on the frozen lakes, but beware, things might get destroyed when they thaw

Needs HugsLib to be loaded before. Uses Harmony.
